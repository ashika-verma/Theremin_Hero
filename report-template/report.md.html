For our 6.08 final reports, we require each team create a site report (structure up to you), but we'd strongly recommend building a Markdown-centric report since the learning curve is very shallow, allowing everyone on the team to quickly get up to speed and 

Instead of using raw HTML which can be annoying to write in, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a really nice alternative since the syntax is extremely lightweight allowing you to focus on content rather than matching tags, etc.  Markdown on its own usually requires some sort of processor, perhaps on the server hosting the files so that it can utimately turn it into HTML, however there have been several attemps at doing this client-side, meaning within the browser.  One approach to this, we recommend is [MarkDeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) found here.  This allows you to quickly create a decent looking html document in a number of supported styles (including a LaTeXy one.  The person who wrote it wrote up some nice documentation as well, [found here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html).  

This page you're currently reading, in fact, is written/rendered using MarkDeep. (go ahead and right/control-click on this page and see the source!)

Example section!


Subsection

![Figure [block-diagram]: some text text](./images/block-diagram.png width="500px" border="1")

Example subsection

For images, and other static media, try to place them all in a reasonable directory structure like we do below

![Figure [granada]: Example image...a 75-77 (didn't want to get too close to check) Ford Granada Coupe I spotted in my neighborhood two weekends ago! Look at that thing.](./images/granada.png width="400px" border="1")

For small videos, you can upload/include them with your static files like images.  For larger videos, strongly consider hosting on a resource like Youtube!

Markdeep features some really nice ASCII-based block-diagrams if you want to use them (and are patient enough)


Questions?

Questions?  Read the docs for markdeep (the feature demo in particular). They are nice, but for 6.08-specific formatting rules, please feel free to post on Piazza!
