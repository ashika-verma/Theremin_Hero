# 608-s19-final-project
This repo consists of three groups:
* Hardware code (/hardware):
  * This is the code that we currently run (or used to test) on the ESP32
  * The primary file in this folder is ui_tools; the rest were proofs of concepts
* Server code (/server):
  * This houses the server and website code for handling scores and otherwise
* Report template (/report-templtae):
  * This houses markdown documentation about this system for the final report
